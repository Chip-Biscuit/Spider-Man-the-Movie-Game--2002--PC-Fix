Always read the README.

Make sure you got the 1.3 patch for this game before you play it its important you can get it here 

https://community.pcgamingwiki.com/files/file/791-spider-man-the-movie-patch-13/

you can edit settings in d3d8.ini 

Default for resolution is 2 (1920 x 1080) resolution and aspect ratio edits are done together so you only have to choose your resolution.

Default for FOV is 0 which is off/ original game FOV you can set it out using either = 1,2, 3 or 4 each one will set camera zoomed out further incrementally. 

Default for FPS is 60 would recommend leaving it set to this personally but its up to you to change it you may experience issues.
